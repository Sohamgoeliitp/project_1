             <title> </title>Dual Degree | B.Tech CS AI-ML ‘28 @ NST x ADYPU | B.Sc CSDA ‘27 @ IIT Patna | AI & Data Viz Enthusiast | Turning Ideas into Action in CSE</title>
                <p>I am a first-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of
                    Technology Patna, pursuing B.Sc. in Computer Science & Data
                    Analytics. Concurrently, I am enrolled in a full-time B.Tech program
                    in Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at Newton School
                    of Technology Pune, in collaboration with Ajeenkya D.Y. Patil
                    University. I am on a mission to complete both degrees, combining
                    the flexibility of hybrid learning with the rigorous experience of full-
                    time study.
                    I have a deep interest in utilizing data analysis to extract valuable
                    insights and am eager to develop my skills in data analysis and
                    artificial intelligence to address real-world challenges. I actively seek
                    opportunities to collaborate on data analysis projects or software
                    development initiatives that create a positive impact. The potential
                    of data science to revolutionize fields such as EdTech & FinTech
                    excites me. I am committed to continuous learning & contributing to
                    this dynamic field.
